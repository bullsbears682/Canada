# üèóÔ∏è Project Culture Manifesto

## **Who We Are**

We are a team of passionate Canadians and allies building tools that solve real problems facing 38 million people. We're not just developers - we're problem solvers, community builders, and advocates for financial empowerment.

## **How We Work**

### **üéØ Mission-Driven Development**
Every line of code serves our mission: helping Canadians make better financial decisions. If a feature doesn't directly contribute to this goal, we question why we're building it.

### **ü§ù Collaborative Excellence**
- **Pair programming** encouraged for complex features
- **Code reviews** are learning opportunities, not gatekeeping
- **Knowledge sharing** through documentation and demos
- **Cross-functional teams** (devs, designers, data scientists)

### **üìä Data-First Mindset**
- **Statistics Canada** is our bible
- **Real-time APIs** over static data
- **Transparent methodology** for all calculations
- **Regular data validation** and quality checks

### **üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Speed with Quality**
- **MVP first**, then iterate based on user feedback
- **Automated testing** for all critical paths
- **Continuous deployment** for rapid iteration
- **Performance monitoring** from day one

## **Our Development Rituals**

### **Daily Standup (9:00 AM EST)**
- What did you accomplish yesterday?
- What are you working on today?
- Any blockers or help needed?
- Quick wins to celebrate?

### **Weekly Planning (Mondays)**
- Review user feedback and metrics
- Plan sprint priorities
- Data source updates and validation
- Team skill development

### **Monthly Retrospective**
- What went well this month?
- What could we improve?
- How are we serving Canadians better?
- Team health and satisfaction

## **Communication Standards**

### **Slack Channels**
- `#general` - Team updates and announcements
- `#dev` - Technical discussions and code help
- `#data` - Data source updates and validation
- `#user-feedback` - User insights and feature requests
- `#canada-news` - Housing market and policy updates

### **Documentation**
- **README first** - If it's not documented, it doesn't exist
- **API documentation** - Clear examples and error handling
- **User guides** - Help Canadians use our tools effectively
- **Technical decisions** - Documented in ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)

## **Quality Standards**

### **Code Quality**
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **ESLint + Prettier** for consistent formatting
- **Unit tests** for all business logic
- **Integration tests** for API endpoints
- **Performance tests** for critical user paths

### **Data Quality**
- **Source validation** - Only official government data
- **Freshness checks** - Data must be current
- **Accuracy verification** - Cross-reference multiple sources
- **Error handling** - Graceful degradation when data unavailable

### **User Experience**
- **Mobile-first design** - 90% of users on mobile
- **Accessibility compliance** - WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Performance targets** - <2 second load times
- **Offline capabilities** - Basic functionality without internet

## **Learning and Growth**

### **Skill Development**
- **Weekly tech talks** - Share new learnings
- **Conference attendance** - Bring back insights
- **Open source contributions** - Give back to community
- **Mentorship program** - Senior devs help juniors

### **Knowledge Sharing**
- **Documentation reviews** - Keep docs current and helpful
- **Code walkthroughs** - Explain complex implementations
- **Architecture discussions** - Involve team in major decisions
- **User research sharing** - Understand Canadian needs better

## **Success Metrics**

### **Technical Metrics**
- **99.9% uptime** - Canadians depend on us
- **<2 second response time** - Fast user experience
- **Zero critical bugs** - Data accuracy is non-negotiable
- **100% test coverage** for critical paths

### **User Metrics**
- **User engagement** - Time spent using tools
- **Feature adoption** - Which tools are most valuable
- **User satisfaction** - NPS scores and feedback
- **Regional usage** - Are we serving all of Canada?

### **Business Metrics**
- **Data accuracy** - How reliable are our insights
- **User growth** - More Canadians using our tools
- **Partnership growth** - Government and industry relationships
- **Community impact** - Stories of users making better decisions

## **Conflict Resolution**

### **Disagreement Framework**
1. **State the facts** - What do we know for certain?
2. **Share perspectives** - Why do you see it differently?
3. **Find common ground** - What do we agree on?
4. **Make a decision** - Move forward with best available option
5. **Learn and iterate** - Apply learnings to future decisions

### **Escalation Path**
- **Direct conversation** - Talk to the person first
- **Team lead involvement** - If direct conversation doesn't resolve
- **Team discussion** - Bring to the whole team if needed
- **External mediation** - Only as last resort

## **Celebration and Recognition**
